# Guess the Number Game

This is my first project made with JavaScript.

This project is part of my training at Alura Latam and was the final project of the course "Programming Logic - Introduction to JavaScript."

The project consists of 4 parts:

1. **app.js** – This script implements the logic of the "Guess the Number" game.
2. **index.html** – This file contains the visual structure of the game.
3. **style.css** – This file defines the styles used in `index.html`.
4. **img/** – This folder contains the images used in `index.html`.
